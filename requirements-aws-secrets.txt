# This file contains the additional dependencies required for storing OAuth 2.0 tokens remotely in AWS Secrets Manager
# (aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager), rather than in the local configuration file.
#
# - This will only be applied to accounts which have an `aws_secret` parameter set in the local configuration file,
#   containing the ARN or name of the secret.
#
# - To use AWS Secrets Manager you must also set up authentication credentials for your AWS account:
#   https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration
#
#     - The minimal required permissions for each AWS Secret used are:
#         "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
#         "secretsmanager:PutSecretValue"
#
#     - If an AWS Secret does not yet exist, the following permissions are also required:
#         "secretsmanager:CreateSecret"
