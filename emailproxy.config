# This is a sample Email OAuth 2.0 Proxy configuration file.
# Configure the proxy by adding items in the servers and accounts sections below.
# Examples are given for Gmail and Office 365 (though you will need to enter your own API client credentials)


# Servers are specified as follows, where, for exammple, the heading [IMAP-1993] gives the type (which can be 
# IMAP or SMTP) and the local port to listen on (i.e., 1993 here). The local port number must be above 1023
# (unless you run via sudo), and port numbers must be unique. Multiple accounts can share the same server.
# A SSL connection to the remote server is assumed by default. If your SMTP server uses the STARTTLS protocol, add
# starttls = True, as shown in the example, and this will be handled by the proxy (assumed to be False otherwise).
# You should configure your client to use an unencrypted connection for both SMTP and IMAP.
# If the property 'local_address' is not specified, its value is assumed to be 'localhost'

[IMAP-1993]
local_address = localhost
server_address = outlook.office365.com
server_port = 993
starttls = True

[IMAP-1995]
server_address = imap.gmail.com
server_port = 993

[SMTP-1587]
server_address = smtp.office365.com
server_port = 587

[SMTP-1465]
server_address = smtp.gmail.com
server_port = 465


# Accounts are specified with your email address as the heading (e.g., [your.office365.address@example.com], below).
# The examples given will work for Office 365 and Gmail, but you will need to add your own client_id and client_secret.
# For Office 365 there is also an optional tenant identifier - if your configuration needs this parameter, place it
# in permission_url and token_url in place of 'common' in the example below. For more details about this, see the links
# and doucumentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app.
# After the first time logging in to your account, the access token details will be cached in this configuration file,
# encrypted with the password you use in your email client. The password used in your email client is not used
# for authentication (which is done separately via a web browser), so can be different to your real account password.
